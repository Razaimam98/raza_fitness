        Eating the right foods is essential for your fitness journey. Focus on a balanced diet rich in proteins, 
        complex carbs, healthy fats, and plenty of vegetables. Vegetarian athletes can include lentils, beans, 
        quinoa, tofu, and dairy for protein. Hydration is crucial â€” drink at least 2-3 liters of water daily. 
        Supplements like whey protein, creatine, and multivitamins can help fill dietary gaps. Avoid processed 
        foods and sugary drinks. Plan meals ahead, track your calorie intake, and make small, sustainable changes 
        for long-term health and muscle growth.
