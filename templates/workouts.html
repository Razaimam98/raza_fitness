        Effective workouts combine strength training and cardio. A push-pull-legs split is popular among 
        fitness enthusiasts for building muscle efficiently. Include compound movements like squats, deadlifts, 
        bench press, and rows. Always warm up before training and cool down afterward. Progressive overload 
        ensures continuous improvement â€” gradually increase weights or reps. Rest is essential; muscles grow 
        during recovery. Consistency, proper form, and a positive mindset are keys to achieving your fitness goals.
