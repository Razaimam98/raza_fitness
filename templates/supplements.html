        Supplements can help improve performance and support recovery, but they are not a replacement for a 
        balanced diet. Essential supplements include protein powders, creatine, BCAAs, omega-3s, and 
        multivitamins. Make sure to follow the recommended dosages and consult a healthcare professional before 
        starting anything new. Quality matters â€” choose trusted brands. Supplements are most effective when 
        combined with consistent training, good sleep, and proper nutrition.
